# This is a repository for optimized jupyter notbook files and pipelines for DAMASK simulation

# Pre-Processing before Simulation

- ## Preprocessing of .ang files to convert into dream3D
- ## Converting of .ang files to DREAM3D files (json pipeline)
- ## Processing .dream3d files into material.yaml and grid files


# Post-Processing DAMASK result file (.hdf5)

- ## Adding Von-Mises Stress and Strain to the result
- ## Outputting VTK file
- ## Getting Stress, Strain and Time data as csv file
- ## Getting out a .ang file (needs input .ang file, which we converted to dream3d file) which has resultant texture and CI and IQ replaced as vM stress and strain.
- ## Creating a resultant vM Stress vs Strain Graph
